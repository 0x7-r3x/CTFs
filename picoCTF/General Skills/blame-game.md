## üßæ Text Walkthrough

### Steps:

1. Download the challenge file using:

   ```bash
   wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/159/challenge.zip
   ```
2. Unzip the downloaded file:

   ```bash
   unzip challenge.zip
   ```
3. Move into the extracted directory:

   ```bash
   cd drop-in/
   ```
4. We are told the program isn‚Äôt working and need to find out *who* is responsible.
5. A normal `git log` is not enough since the repo has many changes.
6. Narrow down the investigation to a specific file suspected in the issue:

   ```bash
   git log message.py
   ```
7. Look through the commit messages to identify suspicious changes.
8. Find the commit with message:

   ```
   optimize file size of prod code
   ```
9. The author of this commit is the flag.
